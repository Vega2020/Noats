## Overview:
Noats is an app that finds recipes and allows the user to save and comment on them. It uses SQL to build an internal database of recipes and notes, which the user can review to build up a repertoire of go-to meals with comments about  the best way to prepare them.
        
## Installation:  
Noats is a browser-based app that can be accessed here.
        
## Usage:  
Create an account with a name and password. The app will present a search bar that draws recipes from the Spoonacular API and displays them. The text box below the recipe can then be used to save comments ("noats") that will be associated with the recipe in the user's personal database. Noats can be used to record successes or modifications to recipes.
